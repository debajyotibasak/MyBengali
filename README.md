_It is done with the help of Udacity's "Multi-screen Application" development tutorials._

**Features:**
- Bengali Translation along with English Translation
- Audio for correct pronunciation by pressing on Each Translation 
- Tabbed navigation pattern for quick and easy navigation.
- Design support for both portrait and landscape orientation.

**What I have learned from this project:**
- Planning an app design and navigation before coding.
- Working with Intents and Activities.
- View Recycling
- Using Mediaplayer class, AudioManager Service and Audio focus 
- Navigating between sections using ViewPager and TabLayout.
